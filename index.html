        <h2>Term Project</h2>
        <p>For my term project, I am working on developing a comprehensive 4-wheeler vehicle inventory system. The project focuses on tracking and managing data for vehicles produced between 2000 and 2024. It includes detailed records of vehicle models, comparisons, and analysis tools to enhance data management and accessibility. The project also incorporates vehicle information from both India and the USA, helping international students and audiences make informed comparisons between brands from these countries. This system will also support partnerships with car dealerships and manufacturers.</p>
