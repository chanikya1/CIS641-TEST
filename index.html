        <h2>Term Project <button class="heading-button">Learn More</button></h2>
        <p>For my term project this semester, I am developing a comprehensive vehicle inventory system focused on 4-wheeler vehicles produced between 2000 and 2024. The system will serve as an informative platform for potential car buyers, allowing them to compare various models and brands from both India and the USA. The goal is to help international students, like myself, who may be unfamiliar with car brands and models in the USA, make informed decisions when purchasing a vehicle.</p>
        <p>The project involves creating a user-friendly web application that allows users to search for specific car models, view detailed specifications, and compare vehicles based on performance, features, and pricing. In addition to facilitating car comparisons, the system also opens potential partnerships with dealerships and manufacturers for greater outreach.</p>
        <p>Throughout the semester, I have been focusing on key aspects such as data management, user interface design, and search functionalities, while also ensuring the platform meets non-functional requirements like security, scalability, and high availability. This project not only showcases my technical skills but also addresses a real-world problem, adding significant value to my academic and professional journey.</p>
