    <!-- Term Project Section -->
    <section>
        <h2>Term Project: 4-Wheeler Vehicle Inventory System</h2>
        <p>The 4-Wheeler Vehicle Inventory System is a comprehensive project aimed at tracking and managing data for 4-wheeler vehicles produced between 2000 and 2024. The system allows users to search for vehicles, compare different models, and view detailed specifications, such as engine capacity, mileage, and safety features.</p>
        <p>In this project, I implemented features like a responsive design, an advanced search filter, and comparison tools, which help potential buyers make informed decisions. The system also includes analytics to track popular vehicle models and provides an admin panel for managing vehicle inventories.</p>
        <p><strong>Tools and Technologies:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Python (for backend data management), and cloud-based deployment using Google Cloud Platform (GCP).</p>
